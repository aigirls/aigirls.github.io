We are a global non-profit organization focused on enabling women to play
an active role in the building and shaping of AI algorithms. We achieve this
through training, enabling career pathways, advocacy and building solutions
that focus on issues unique to women.
We are a global organization with a vision to have chapters wherever women
and girls are interested in playing an active role in shaping algorithms.
